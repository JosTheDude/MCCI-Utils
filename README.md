# What is MCCI Utils?â€‹
MCCI Utils is a mod made by myself which helps with all things MCC Island. It provides some quality of life features to make your time on MCC Island just that bit more fun and enjoyable. I am constantly looking for suggestions for things to add and can't wait for you to try it out.

Currently the mod contains the following features:
- Discord Status
- Friend Join Notifications (With Custom Sounds)
- Chat Mentions (With Custom Sound)
- Quest and Achievement notifications
- Custom Toasts
- Icon showing who is using the mod
- Stacking duplicate messages
- Secret Easter Eggs
- And more (Check the change logs)

*Currently the mod is in alpha and I will be slowly adding features as I see fit.*

If you wish to suggest features or help contribute to the project, check out the [GitHub](https://github.com/TheMysterys/MCCI-Utils)

**Optional dependencies:**  
[Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu/) and [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) allow you to change mod settings within the game but are not required for it to work.

# Does this mod add music?
This mod does not add music due to it being added to the server as a option at a later time. I also didn't want to steal an idea from a mod that has already been released "Island Utils"
